# FieldMap - MapLibre Migration

## Project context
FieldMap is a PWA for hunters/outdoor recreationists to manage pins, routes, areas, and bearings on a map. Built in vanilla JS, single HTML file (index.html), Firebase/Firestore backend.

## Current state
Pins, routes, areas, and bearings are all fully ported to MapLibre — draw, edit, vertex/endpoint editing,
and persisted rendering all work with no remaining Leaflet (`L.*`) calls in any of those four item types.
- Pins render as maplibregl.Marker with custom SVG HTML (buildPinMarkerHtml)
- Routes/areas/bearings all render from shared GeoJSON sources (tracks-source, polygons-source,
  bearings-source) rather than one Leaflet layer per item — see Architecture notes
- Style switching works — everything persists correctly across all base layer switches, including
  off-screen items and anything mid-draw or mid-edit at the moment of the switch
- Clustering is temporarily disabled: all pins always show as individual markers regardless of zoom. The
  cluster-circles/cluster-counts bubble layers and pins-source still exist but no longer drive individual
  marker visibility (see Architecture notes) — proper clustering to be implemented in a later session

## What's broken (expected, to be fixed in later sessions)
- Draw/measure tools other than route/area drawing (the standalone "measure" ruler tool, elevation tap,
  compass bearing lines, GPX search-result marker) — still L.circleMarker/L.polyline based
- All overlay toggles (FSTopo, MVUM, public land, hydro, snow depth, NLCD)
- GMU boundaries, sun-path arc, offline-area boundary rectangles — still L.geoJSON/L.rectangle based
- GPS accuracy circle (gpsAccCircle) — needs MapLibre source/layer
- "Edit shape" vertex-editing exists for both routes and areas; there is no equivalent "edit vertices" for
  polygons drawn via the (still-Leaflet) offline-boundary rectangles — not in scope, different feature

## Architecture notes
- Single file app: index.html (~9000 lines)
- Mapbox token in const MAPBOX_TOKEN; 3 styles in MAPBOX_STYLES (topo default — local topo-style.json, aerial, aerial-streets); Street removed
- refresh-style.js (project root, run with `node refresh-style.js`) re-fetches topo-style.json from Mapbox Studio and re-applies the sprite/glyphs/source-url token-placeholder transforms
- GPS dot: 3-state machine (off/following/free) using gpsDotState + maplibregl.Marker
- Base layer switching: loadStyle(styleName) fetches (topo-style.json locally, others via MAPBOX_STYLES URLs) + strips name + rewrites mapbox:// refs, then map.setStyle(styleObj, {diff:false}) — diff:false forces a full teardown-and-rebuild on every switch; MapLibre's incremental diff path was silently failing to carry over reinitializeLayers()'s custom layers on repaint
- mapbox:// source URLs resolved via https://api.mapbox.com/v4/{id}.json?secure&access_token=TOKEN
- Pin markers: maplibregl.Marker + custom HTML (buildPinMarkerHtml), maplibregl.Popup, openPopup() polyfill
- pins-source (GeoJSON, cluster:true) + cluster-circles/cluster-counts layers still exist and are re-added by
  reinitializeLayers(), but only drive the aggregated bubble count display now
- Routes: tracks-source (GeoJSON LineStrings) + tracks-line/tracks-line-touch layers. Areas: polygons-source
  (GeoJSON Polygons) + polygons-fill/polygons-line layers, plus separate maplibregl.Marker labels at each
  area's bounding-box center. Bearings: bearings-source (GeoJSON LineStrings, dashed) +
  bearings-line/bearings-line-touch layers, plus a separate maplibregl.Marker per bearing for the target dot
  (needs its own independent click target). All three use the same addXToMap/removeXFromMap/refreshXMap →
  scheduleXRefresh() → updateXSource() debounced-rebuild pattern as pins-source, and all skip a per-item
  Leaflet layer object entirely (trackLayersById-style dicts were removed once nothing populated them)
- Ad-hoc popups (openTrackPopupAt/openPolygonPopupAt/openBearingPopupAt) since these item types have no
  persistent marker/popup object like pins do — each keeps a single shared module-level "currently open"
  reference so any entry point (map click, sidebar click, Edit shape/Edit endpoints) can close whichever is open
- In-progress draw previews: draw-preview-source (routes), polygon-draw-preview-source (areas, fill+line),
  bearing-draw-preview-source (bearings). Vertex/endpoint editing of an *existing* saved item reuses two more:
  vertex-edit-preview-source (shared between route and area vertex-edit — mutually exclusive modes, fill layer
  is a no-op for LineString geometry) and bearing-endpoint-preview-source. All of these are re-added and
  resynced (redrawDrawLine/redrawPolygonDraft/redrawBearingDrawPreview/vertexEditSyncFn/bearingEndpointSyncFn)
  at the end of reinitializeLayers(), so a style switch mid-draw or mid-edit doesn't lose the in-progress state
- reinitializeLayers() called on map.on('style.load') — rebuilds every pin marker fresh (remove + re-add all),
  re-adds all sources/layers, and resyncs all draw/edit previews after every setStyle()
- updateMarkerVisibility() called on map.on('idle') — always shows every pin marker (subject only to the
  filter-panel mapItemVisible() check); no longer hides markers based on cluster-source query results, since
  querySourceFeatures() only sees currently rendered/loaded tiles and was hiding off-screen pins after a style
  switch. A clustered pin may render its marker underneath the cluster bubble for now.

## Session history
- Session 1: Leaflet → MapLibre swap, base layers, GPS dot, scale bar, zoom controls
- Session 2: Pin rendering (maplibregl.Marker), 4→3-style switcher (Street removed, topo default via local
  topo-style.json + refresh-style.js), modal close/sidebar-refresh fixes for pins/bearings/tracks/areas,
  bearing-tap crash guard, pin-marker persistence fix across style switches, clustering temporarily disabled
- Session 3: Draw Route fully ported to MapLibre (tracks-source, draw preview, vertex editing). Diagnosed and
  fixed pins/tracks disappearing on style switch (map.setStyle diff:false). UX redesign: 6→5 status colors
  with migration, all 4 modals redesigned (quick-category chips, collapsible category list, header row with
  top Save/Cancel), Directions/Copy coords buttons on pin popup
- Session 4: Draw Area and Bearing tool fully ported to MapLibre, following the same pattern as Draw Route —
  polygons-source/bearings-source, draw previews, vertex editing (areas) and endpoint remap (bearings). No
  more L.* calls remain anywhere in the pin/route/area/bearing code paths.
