# FieldMap - MapLibre Migration

## Project context
FieldMap is a PWA for hunters/outdoor recreationists to manage pins, routes, areas, and bearings on a map. Built in vanilla JS, single HTML file (index.html), Firebase/Firestore backend.

## Current state
Pins, routes, areas, and bearings are all fully ported to MapLibre — draw, edit, vertex/endpoint editing,
and persisted rendering all work with no remaining Leaflet (`L.*`) calls in any of those four item types.
- Pins render as maplibregl.Marker with custom SVG HTML (buildPinMarkerHtml)
- Routes/areas/bearings all render from shared GeoJSON sources (tracks-source, polygons-source,
  bearings-source) rather than one Leaflet layer per item — see Architecture notes
- Style switching works — everything persists correctly across all base layer switches, including
  off-screen items and anything mid-draw or mid-edit at the moment of the switch
- Clustering is temporarily disabled: all pins always show as individual markers regardless of zoom. The
  cluster-circles/cluster-counts bubble layers and pins-source still exist but no longer drive individual
  marker visibility (see Architecture notes) — proper clustering to be implemented in a later session

## What's broken (expected, to be fixed in later sessions)
- Draw/measure tools other than route/area drawing (the standalone "measure" ruler tool, elevation tap,
  compass bearing lines, GPX search-result marker) — still L.circleMarker/L.polyline based
- All overlay toggles (FSTopo, MVUM, public land, hydro, snow depth, NLCD)
- Sun-path arc, offline-area boundary rectangles — still L.geoJSON/L.rectangle based
- GPS accuracy circle (gpsAccCircle) — needs MapLibre source/layer
- "Edit shape" vertex-editing exists for both routes and areas; there is no equivalent "edit vertices" for
  polygons drawn via the (still-Leaflet) offline-boundary rectangles — not in scope, different feature
- FIXED performance bug (was: every GMU toggle-on, even a cache hit, paid a 20-40+ second synchronous
  main-thread cost): buildLabelPointFeatureCollection's per-feature pole-of-inaccessibility grid search
  (bestLabelPointForGeometry) is genuinely expensive on real government boundary data (Idaho: 100 features/
  558K ring vertices = ~40s; Utah: 152 features/571K vertices = ~40s — confirmed via [GMU-PERF] console.log
  instrumentation, left in place, in ensureGmuStateLoaded/readGmuDurableCache/showGmuState/
  buildLabelPointFeatureCollection). Root cause is the agency data being full legal-boundary precision
  (20+MB/state) rather than web-mapping-simplified — not specific to Idaho, not caused by this session's
  caching work (which correctly eliminated network latency; it just exposed that label computation, not
  network, was always the dominant cost). Fix: the computed label-point FeatureCollection is now cached
  alongside the raw GeoJSON — in-memory (gmuLabelCache) and in the same durable Cache API entry as gmuCache's
  data (writeGmuDurableCache/readGmuDurableCache now store/read {data, labelFc}, with backward-compat for
  cache entries written before this — a bare FeatureCollection is treated as "labels not computed yet").
  showGmuState only invokes buildLabelPointFeatureCollection when labelFc is missing; a genuine one-time
  computation shows an honest toast ("[State] unit labels — setting up (one-time)…", via showToast/
  hideToastNow) with a double-requestAnimationFrame yield first so the toast actually paints before the
  synchronous work blocks the thread. Verified: first-ever toggle for a state still takes the full ~40s with
  the toast visible throughout; every later toggle (same session, in-memory hit) drops to ~180-300ms sync
  work (150-230x faster); a toggle after a full page reload (durable-cache hit including labelFc) is
  ~1-1.5s (just JSON-parsing the larger cached blob, no recomputation) — confirmed for both Idaho and Utah.

## Architecture notes
- Single file app: index.html (~9000 lines)
- Mapbox token in const MAPBOX_TOKEN; 3 styles in MAPBOX_STYLES (topo default — local topo-style.json, aerial, aerial-streets); Street removed
- refresh-style.js (project root, run with `node refresh-style.js`) re-fetches topo-style.json from Mapbox Studio and re-applies the sprite/glyphs/source-url token-placeholder transforms
- GPS dot: 3-state machine (off/following/free) using gpsDotState + maplibregl.Marker
- Base layer switching: loadStyle(styleName) fetches (topo-style.json locally, others via MAPBOX_STYLES URLs) + strips name + rewrites mapbox:// refs, then map.setStyle(styleObj, {diff:false}) — diff:false forces a full teardown-and-rebuild on every switch; MapLibre's incremental diff path was silently failing to carry over reinitializeLayers()'s custom layers on repaint
- mapbox:// source URLs resolved via https://api.mapbox.com/v4/{id}.json?secure&access_token=TOKEN
- Pin markers: maplibregl.Marker + custom HTML (buildPinMarkerHtml), maplibregl.Popup, openPopup() polyfill
- pins-source (GeoJSON, cluster:true) + cluster-circles/cluster-counts layers still exist and are re-added by
  reinitializeLayers(), but only drive the aggregated bubble count display now
- Routes: tracks-source (GeoJSON LineStrings) + tracks-line/tracks-line-touch layers. Areas: polygons-source
  (GeoJSON Polygons) + polygons-fill/polygons-line layers, plus separate maplibregl.Marker labels at each
  area's bounding-box center. Bearings: bearings-source (GeoJSON LineStrings, dashed) +
  bearings-line/bearings-line-touch layers, plus a separate maplibregl.Marker per bearing for the target dot
  (needs its own independent click target). All three use the same addXToMap/removeXFromMap/refreshXMap →
  scheduleXRefresh() → updateXSource() debounced-rebuild pattern as pins-source, and all skip a per-item
  Leaflet layer object entirely (trackLayersById-style dicts were removed once nothing populated them)
- Ad-hoc popups (openTrackPopupAt/openPolygonPopupAt/openBearingPopupAt) since these item types have no
  persistent marker/popup object like pins do — each keeps a single shared module-level "currently open"
  reference so any entry point (map click, sidebar click, Edit shape/Edit endpoints) can close whichever is open
- In-progress draw previews: draw-preview-source (routes), polygon-draw-preview-source (areas, fill+line),
  bearing-draw-preview-source (bearings). Vertex/endpoint editing of an *existing* saved item reuses two more:
  vertex-edit-preview-source (shared between route and area vertex-edit — mutually exclusive modes, fill layer
  is a no-op for LineString geometry) and bearing-endpoint-preview-source. All of these are re-added and
  resynced (redrawDrawLine/redrawPolygonDraft/redrawBearingDrawPreview/vertexEditSyncFn/bearingEndpointSyncFn)
  at the end of reinitializeLayers(), so a style switch mid-draw or mid-edit doesn't lose the in-progress state
- reinitializeLayers() called on map.on('style.load') — rebuilds every pin marker fresh (remove + re-add all),
  re-adds all sources/layers, and resyncs all draw/edit previews after every setStyle()
- updateMarkerVisibility() called on map.on('idle') — always shows every pin marker (subject only to the
  filter-panel mapItemVisible() check); no longer hides markers based on cluster-source query results, since
  querySourceFeatures() only sees currently rendered/loaded tiles and was hiding off-screen pins after a style
  switch. A clustered pin may render its marker underneath the cluster bubble for now.
- GMU boundaries: MapLibre-based, single-select state picker (#gmu-state-select), one state's fill/line/label
  layers visible at a time. Table-driven via a GMU_STATES catalog object (url, labelField, popupTitle/popupMeta
  functions, infoLabel/infoUrl, optional filterFeature) — adding a state is one catalog entry, not bespoke code.
  Generic shared functions: ensureGmuStateLoaded/showGmuState/setGmuStateLayersVisible/gmuPopupHtml/
  openGmuPopupAt/setGmuOn/setGmuActiveState. Click handlers registered once in createMap() via a loop over
  Object.keys(GMU_STATES). Currently built: az, or, ut, id, nv, wa (see gmuCache/GMU_STATES near the top of
  the script for full source URLs/field notes/research findings per state).
- GMU per-state durable cache: each state's fetched (and filtered) GeoJSON is written to the Cache API under
  GMU_DATA_CACHE_NAME ('fieldmap-gmu-data-v1', synthetic same-origin key per state via gmuCacheEntryUrl) with
  a fetch timestamp in a separate localStorage entry (GMU_CACHE_META_KEY, deliberately NOT part of
  state.settings/Firestore sync — cache freshness is a local-storage fact, not a synced preference).
  ensureGmuStateLoaded reads the durable cache first and uses it unconditionally at any age (instant,
  offline-capable); the timestamp only drives the "Unit boundaries as of [date]" text in the state picker and
  a non-blocking "consider refreshing" nudge past GMU_CACHE_STALE_DAYS (180) — never a forced re-fetch or
  dialog. refreshGmuState() is the only path that bypasses the cache. IMPORTANT: service-worker.js's activate
  handler whitelist (SHELL_CACHE/TILE_CACHE/GMU_DATA_CACHE) must keep GMU_DATA_CACHE's literal string in sync
  with index.html's GMU_DATA_CACHE_NAME — otherwise every SHELL_CACHE bump wipes the GMU cache, since Cache
  Storage is shared per-origin regardless of which context (page vs. SW) created an entry.
- GMU liability disclaimer: identical text in two places — a persistent line under the GMU row in the Layers
  panel (always visible, not dismissible) and a `.gmu-disclaimer`-classed line appended in every GMU popup
  (gmuPopupHtml), regardless of whether that state has an info link.
- Known test-environment gotcha (not an app bug): both IDFG (Idaho) and WDFW (Washington) self-hosted ArcGIS
  servers intermittently reject automated-browser (Playwright) fetches — confirmed via matching non-browser
  requests succeeding reliably, and confirmed NOT CORS/header-related. Also confirmed the app's own service
  worker intercepts cross-origin fetches not in its BYPASS_HOSTS list and issues its own pass-through fetch
  from the SW execution context, which Playwright's page.route() does not reliably intercept — disable SW
  registration in any test that needs to mock a GMU state's live endpoint (see verify_gmu_cache_mechanics.js
  pattern in scratch test history). Real end-user browsers are not expected to hit either issue.

## Session history
- Session 1: Leaflet → MapLibre swap, base layers, GPS dot, scale bar, zoom controls
- Session 2: Pin rendering (maplibregl.Marker), 4→3-style switcher (Street removed, topo default via local
  topo-style.json + refresh-style.js), modal close/sidebar-refresh fixes for pins/bearings/tracks/areas,
  bearing-tap crash guard, pin-marker persistence fix across style switches, clustering temporarily disabled
- Session 3: Draw Route fully ported to MapLibre (tracks-source, draw preview, vertex editing). Diagnosed and
  fixed pins/tracks disappearing on style switch (map.setStyle diff:false). UX redesign: 6→5 status colors
  with migration, all 4 modals redesigned (quick-category chips, collapsible category list, header row with
  top Save/Cancel), Directions/Copy coords buttons on pin popup
- Session 4: Draw Area and Bearing tool fully ported to MapLibre, following the same pattern as Draw Route —
  polygons-source/bearings-source, draw previews, vertex editing (areas) and endpoint remap (bearings). No
  more L.* calls remain anywhere in the pin/route/area/bearing code paths.
- Session 5: GMU boundaries refactored from bespoke 2-state (AZ/OR) code to a table-driven GMU_STATES catalog
  + generic shared functions (see Architecture notes). Added Utah, Idaho, Nevada as fully-built, verified
  states. Researched and confirmed Washington's live source (WDFW ArcGIS FeatureServer) but left it out of
  GMU_STATES pending go-ahead, per explicit instruction not to build on a guess. Verified AZ/OR/UT/NV
  end-to-end (load, single-select, click-to-popup with correct title/link) via Playwright; root-caused a
  string of false "broken popup" test failures back to test-harness bugs (canvas-vs-page coordinate offset
  from the sidebar, naive polygon-centroid misses on concave shapes) rather than app bugs. Idaho's data/fields
  independently confirmed correct via direct API calls, but in-browser Playwright verification was blocked by
  IDFG's self-hosted ArcGIS server rejecting automated-browser traffic (403, headed and headless) while
  identical non-browser requests succeeded — likely bot/WAF detection on their end, not a FieldMap bug, but
  unconfirmed whether real end-user browsers ever hit the same wall.
- Session 6: Washington wired into GMU_STATES (WDFW ArcGIS FeatureServer, 162 features, GMU_Num/GMU_Name
  fields, per-unit PDF info link) — all 6 states now built. Added durable per-state GMU boundary caching
  (Cache API + localStorage timestamp, see Architecture notes) with an unobtrusive freshness indicator and
  manual refresh in the state picker, and a persistent liability disclaimer in both the Layers panel and every
  GMU popup. Verified end-to-end via Playwright: WA renders/pops up correctly, single-select confirmed across
  all 5 non-Idaho states, durable cache confirmed to load instantly with zero network requests on a page
  reload, manual refresh confirmed to force exactly one live re-fetch and update the timestamp, and the
  180-day stale nudge confirmed to render as inline text with no blocking dialog. Also discovered (see
  Architecture notes) that the service worker's generic fetch passthrough intercepts GMU requests before
  Playwright's page.route() can, which was the actual cause of an initial "WA fetch never fires" false alarm —
  a test-environment fix (disable SW registration in the test), not an app change.
- Session 7: Investigated a user report of GMU state loads still being slow (Idaho: 27s first load, 18s on a
  cached reload) despite Session 6's caching confirming zero network requests. Added [GMU-PERF] timing
  instrumentation and profiled with real (not trimmed/mocked) live agency data fetched via Node — discovered
  the actual live payloads are 7-23MB per state (not a PowerShell-serialization artifact as previously
  assumed in Session 6's testing). Root-caused the slowness to buildLabelPointFeatureCollection, not network
  or caching (see Architecture notes' "FIXED performance bug" entry for full detail and the fix applied).
- Session 8: Fixed a bearing-delete persistence bug — deleteBearingById was the only one of the four
  pin/track/polygon/bearing delete functions NOT calling recordTombstone(id) before scheduleSave(). Confirmed
  via direct code comparison (deletePinById/deleteTrackById/deletePolygonById all call it; deleteBearingById
  didn't) and via mergeStates' logic (mergeArray only drops an id if it's in state.tombstones — an untracked
  delete is indistinguishable from "never existed on this device" during a merge). This meant any Firestore
  snapshot arriving after a local bearing delete but before that delete's own debounced cloud push completed —
  performInitialSync on a fast reload, or startLiveSync's onSnapshot on any device — would resurrect the
  bearing via mergeStates' union-by-id logic, and push that resurrection back to Firestore, undoing the delete
  permanently. Fix: added the missing recordTombstone(id) call, matching the pin/track/polygon pattern exactly.
  Verified via localStorage inspection (not just UI state) that state.tombstones now correctly contains a
  deleted bearing's id and it stays gone after a real page reload; also verified bearing create/edit still
  work unaffected (single-line, additive fix — no other delete path was touched).
